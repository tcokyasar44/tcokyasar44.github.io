            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a Computational Transportation Engineer at the Vehicle and Mobility Systems Department of Argonne National Laboratory, and I have been serving the Department with various titles since 2020. I obtained my Bachelor's in Business Administration from Nevsehir University in 2012. After working at Kuwait-Turkish Participation Bank for two years, I was awarded a scholarship by the Turkish Ministry of National Education allowing me to pursue my graduate studies in the U.S. I attended the Intensive English Program at the University of Georgia in 2014. I gained my M.S and Ph.D. degrees in Industrial Engineering from the University of Tennessee in 2016 and 2020, respectively. During my Ph.D., I interned at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Argonne National Laboratory. Following the graduation, I worked at Argonne National Laboratory as a Postdoctoral Researcher. I served to the Department of Industrial Engineering of Tarsus University as an Assistant Professor for nearly two years. I am a father of two: Alparslan and Gunes Azra.</p>
